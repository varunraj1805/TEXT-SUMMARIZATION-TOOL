# DESCRIPTION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INTERNSHIP

## üíº CodTech AI Internship Projects ‚Äì 2025

This repository contains the complete implementation of the *CodTech AI Internship*, focused on building practical Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) projects. Each task covers a different application of AI, using Python and essential libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, NLTK, and PyTorch. These projects demonstrate the integration of various AI tools and techniques in natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.

### üîß Project Structure

The internship includes *four major tasks*:

---

### üìÑ Task 1: Article Summarization

This task implements *natural language processing* techniques to summarize long text articles into shorter, meaningful summaries. It uses libraries like NLTK and Hugging Face Transformers to preprocess the text and apply either an extractive or abstractive summarization model. The goal is to help reduce content length while retaining core meaning‚Äîuseful for content reading, legal summaries, and news apps.

*Key Features*:

* Stopword removal & tokenization
* Text summarization using Transformers (e.g., T5 or BART)
* Clean command-line or GUI interface for input/output

---

### üéô Task 2: Speech-to-Text Converter

This task builds a simple *speech recognition system* using Python‚Äôs speech_recognition library. It takes a .wav audio file as input and converts it to readable text. This can be integrated into voice assistant projects, transcription tools, and accessibility applications.

*Key Features*:

* Converts .wav audio into text
* Handles audio files of various lengths
* Displays or saves transcribed content

---

### üñº Task 3: Neural Style Transfer

This task applies *neural style transfer* using deep learning. A content image is blended with a style image (like a painting), producing a new image that retains the content of the first and the artistic style of the second. This technique uses a pre-trained *VGG-19* model and PyTorch or TensorFlow.

*Key Features*:

* Deep learning-based image processing
* Input: content and style images
* Output: stylized artistic image
* Customizable weights for style vs. content

---

### ‚úç Task 4: Text Generation using GPT/LSTM

This task implements *text generation* using either an LSTM model or the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) architecture. The model is trained on sample text and can then generate new, coherent text in the same style. This technique is foundational in chatbots, story generators, and AI writing tools.

*Key Features*:

* Train on any input text corpus
* Generate coherent, stylistic sentences
* Uses LSTM or pre-trained GPT-2 from Hugging Face

---

### üß∞ Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV
* TensorFlow, PyTorch
* NLTK, Transformers
* SpeechRecognition, Wave
* Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
